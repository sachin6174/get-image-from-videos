**CRITICAL RULES - Adhere Strictly:**
1.  **Identity Preservation is Paramount:** The person's identity in the enhanced image MUST PERFECTLY AND IDENTICALLY MATCH the **reference image**. The reference image is the absolute ground truth for their facial structure, features, and unique expressions. DO NOT alter their appearance from the reference.
2.  **Technical Restoration (on the primary image):**
    - **Clarity & Detail:** Sharpen blurry areas, remove all noise and artifacts, restore fine details, and upscale to a high resolution.
    - **Texture:** Restore natural, realistic skin texture, individual hair strands, and eye details without creating a plastic or artificial look.
    - **Lighting & Tones:** Create balanced, natural lighting. The tones should be realistic and appealing.
    - **Color:** ${colorizeInstruction} Adjust colors to be vibrant and lifelike.
    - **Composition:** Render it as a freshly taken portrait with a sharp focus on the face and a soft, natural background blur (bokeh).
3.  **Final Output:**
    - The result must be ONLY the enhanced primary image. It must not be a merge or composite of the two images.
    - The final image must look like a real, modern photograph, not an AI-generated image.
    - No added text, watermarks, or logos.`;
